              Winterization involves getting a home ready to withstand the harsh winter conditions, typically done in the fall before the onset of snow and extreme cold. This process helps prevent damage from burst water pipes and heat loss due to gaps in the building's exterior. Inspectors should understand the winterization process to educate their clients effectively.

              Water damage from burst pipes in cold weather can be catastrophic. When a pipe bursts, water continues to flow until the supply is shut off, potentially flooding the home and causing extensive damage if no one is there to intervene. Even minor leaks or quickly stopped ruptures can lead to mold and other property damage, and repairing broken pipes can be expensive.

              All exposed water pipes in cold areas, such as attics, garages, and crawlspaces, should be insulated using materials like foam or fiberglass, which are available at most hardware stores. Insulation should cover the entire pipe length. Plastic pipes, more resilient to cold expansion than copper or steel, may be beneficial in colder climates. The water supply to exterior pipes should be shut off from inside the home, and the pipes should be drained.

              Sprinkler systems are especially prone to cracking due to cold-weather expansion. Besides turning them off, it's advisable to use compressed air to clear any remaining water from the system. Homeowners should remember that plumbing often runs through areas much colder than the rest of the house. Since monitoring the temperature of all plumbing sections is impractical, maintaining a sufficiently high indoor temperature throughout the winter is essential to prevent pipes in unheated areas from freezing.
